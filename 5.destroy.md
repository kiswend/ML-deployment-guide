# Delete infra from a fresh control center util

in Gitlab, destroy all environments by running their destroy pipeline


Spin a control center util
```bash
docker run -it -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws ghcr.io/mojaloop/control-center-util:5.0.1 /bin/bash
```

Copy inventory from the gitlab boostrap>CI/CD/artifact. If the same control center util is the one who creaetd the control center, you may directly use its inventory file.

```bash
cd /iac-run-dir
cp /iac-run-dir/output/control-center-deploy/inventory .
./move-state-from-gitlab.sh inventory oss v5.3.8
./destroy-control-center.sh v5.3.8 oss
```
